# A Blog of Hiking Pictures

I wanted to get to know Gatsby better, so, using [`gatsby-starter-portfolio-emma`](https://github.com/LeKoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-emma), I built this. It has photos from various hikes I've gone on, with some additional information about each of those spots.

See the live version [here](@TODO_LINK).
